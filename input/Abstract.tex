\textbf{Abstract:}

In our society, the importance of electrical power consumption has been steadily increasing. In order to keep the economy growing at a constant pace, either more and more energy must be produced or the efficiency of our energy use must be increased. To reduce the power consumption of a single device, it is first necessary to know its power consumption. Therefore, a power measurement device, called P3T7, for individual single-phase devices was designed. To understand the power consumption, P3T7 records the power used over a certain period of time. The device then transmits the data to a program which processes and visualizes the data. To measure the voltage, a voltage divider circuit is used and with two instrument shunts the current measurement can be realized. The circuit for the signal preparation includes amplifiers as well as first-order filters. LT Spice was used to simulate this circuit. The pre-processed signals are then sent to a microcontroller (ATMEGA2560), where the software prepares the data and writes it on an EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory). By using a Bluetooth module, the data is transmitted to a java application which visualizes the data. P3T7 can detect power up to 5W with an uncertainty of 0.5W. Up to a power of 2.3 kW, P3T7 has an uncertainty of 10W. Harmonics can be detected until 1400 Hz. Consumer safety is guaranteed due to a plastic casing which prevents the user from coming into contact with any electrical parts. In conclusion P3T7 could be an advantage for households to trace power consumption and minimize them.
